Using a 400 x 400 canvas I moved a sprite across the canvas on the x axis. The sprite was one I already made and I copy and pasted the function into the code. 
I did this by defining a speed variable, direction variable and x variable. 
I was able to have the sprite move back and forth by using an if statement that commanded the sprite to not go past the width of the canvas and in the 
other direction the spite could not go past an x of 5. 
The directions of the excersise were to have the sprite go in all 4 corners but because of the original x and y postion of my previously made sprite I 
was not able to figure out the correct coordinates of the sprite to move up and down. The sprite was made in the lower left corner instead of the middle.
